Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i.	Attribute table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM attribute

ii. Business table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM business

iii. Category table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM category

iv. Checkin table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM checkin

v. elite_years table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM elite_years

vi. friend table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM friend

vii. hours table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM hours

viii. photo table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM photo

ix. review table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM review

x. tip table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM tip

xi. user table = 10000
SELECT *
FROM user
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i.	Business = 10000
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM business

ii. Hours = 156
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM hours

iii. Category = 264
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM category

iv. Attribute = 111
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM attribute

v. Review = 10000
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM review

vi. Checkin = 49
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM checkin

vii. Photo = 10000
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM photo

viii. Tip = 537
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id)
FROM tip

ix. User = 10000
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM user

x. Friend = 11
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id)
FROM friend

xi. Elite_years = 2780
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id)
FROM elite_years

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Using the following code:
SELECT name, review_count, fans
FROM user	
ORDER BY review_count DESC, fans DESC

I believe that more reviews does NOT correlate with more fans. As the following table was returned and shows Amy with the highest number of fans but not the highest number of reviews.
+-----------+--------------+------+
| name      | review_count | fans |
+-----------+--------------+------+
| Amy       |          609 |  503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1.	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Not really, they all have hours on Saturday is timeframes not too far away from each other.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

The second record, HighLife North Tryon, is located in “University City” which sounds like its near a college thus may have high foot traffic/reviews during the school yer.


SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT *
FROM business
INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_ID = business.ID
INNER JOIN category ON category.business_id = business.id
AND city = 'Charlotte'
GROUP BY stars

+------------------------+----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+-----------+-------+-------------+----------+-----------+-------+--------------+---------+----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+---------------+

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The one that is open has more reviews.
         
ii. Difference 2:
          The one that is open is a resturant and the one that is closed is a bar.
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT *
FROM business
INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = business.id
INNER JOIN category ON category.business_id = business.id
GROUP BY is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    I want to see if a business' category correlates with its review count and stars.     
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
For this analysis, I will need data from the category table regaring which category the businesses are. I will also need basic information from the business table such as the business' review count, name and number of stars. I chose this data because I wanted to see if the businesses with the highest stars or highest review counts have anything in common. For commonalities, I will be looking at the city, state and category columns.  I will also limit my results just enough to where I can see a difference in either the review count or stars count.         
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
     Of the businesses, ordered by review count DESC LIMIT 10, they are all open except Jacques Cafe. 90% of the top 10 results are food/beverage related. 30% of the top results are located in Cleveland, OH and 50% are located in AZ. Only 1 out of the top 10, Green Corner Resturant, is rated 5 stars.When the data is ordered by stars DESC, 60% of the top 10 results are in AZ. 20% are health and medical and 30% are in automotive related categories.
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

I ran two queries, this is the first one:
SELECT business.name, business_id, category,
business.city, business.state, business.stars, business.review_count, business.is_open
FROM category
INNER JOIN business On business.id = category.business_id
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 10
